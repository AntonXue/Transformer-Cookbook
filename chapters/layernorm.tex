\chapter{Layer Normalization}

\subsection{Zero Mean}

Duplicate all dimensions, negate them, so that mean in each position is $0$, then LayerNorm only applies scaling factor

\subsection{Normalize to $\pm1$}

Use FFNN to clip all values to same magnitude, then every value will get scaled to $\pm 1$
