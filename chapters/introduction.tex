All of us have used a transformer at some point in our lives -- either by trying a model that someone else cooked up, or by preparing one ourselves. 
However, few of us know all of the diverse recipes that can be used to concoct such intricate models. 
The standard recipe \citep{vaswani-etal-2017-attention} has been adapted in countless ways within kitchens and labs around the world. 
Different chefs add their own flair and flavor into their constructions, and family recipes have been passed down for generations, each with their own secret sauce. 
Here, we present a comprehensive recipe-book with the folkloric knowledge behind cooking up transformers! 
We hope you enjoy!
